# Simple_Database_Model
In this project, I designed a relational database system for an e-commerce company facing challenges in efficiently managing its growing inventory of products, customer data, and increasing order volumes. Prior to the project, their current system was fragmented and lacked the integration needed to ensure data consistency, streamline order processing, and enhance customer service.I had to design one central database to house all of these data and the following steps were carried out in the process: Identify entities, identify attributes, create an entity relationship diagram (ERD) using the pgAdmin ERD tool, normalise the tables, define keys and relationships, create database objects by generating and running the SQL script generated by the ERD tool. Tools used for this project were PostgreSQL and SQL.
